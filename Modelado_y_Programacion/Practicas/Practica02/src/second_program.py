	Implementar el algoritmo de ordenamiento Insertion Sort

	Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time.
	It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
	However, insertion sort provides several advantages:
    
    	* Simple implementation: Jon Bentley shows a three-line C version, and a five-line optimized version.
    	* Efficient for (quite) small data sets, much like other quadratic sorting algorithms
    	* More efficient in practice than most other simple quadratic (i.e., O(n2)) algorithms such as selection sort or bubble sort
    	* In-place; i.e., only requires a constant amount O(1) of additional memory space
